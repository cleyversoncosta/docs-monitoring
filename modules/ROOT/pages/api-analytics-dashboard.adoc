= API Analytics Dashboards

The API analytics dashboards provide charts to monitor API usage, which gives you insight into how your APIs are used and how they are performing.

The API analytics dashboard includes two views: new metrics and classic metrics.
The new metrics view includes detailed information about your APIs, and charts are sorted into dashboards based on the type of data displayed.
The classic metrics view is deprecated as of January 15, 2020, and it displays information related only to response times and requests for APIs.
To get the most out of Anypoint Monitoring, use the new metrics view to see information related to your APIs.

By default, the new metrics view is selected. To switch views, select *Switch to classic metrics*. From the classic metrics view, select *Show new metrics view*.

[NOTE]
For Gold and Platinum subscriptions, Anypoint Monitoring retains API analytics data for 90 days.
