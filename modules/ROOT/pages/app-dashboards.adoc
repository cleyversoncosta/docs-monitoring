endif::[]

Built-in dashboards display deployment information about your application at the top of the screen and provide access to a number of different graphs, for example:

image::dashboard-built-in-info.png[Deployment Info on an App in a Built-In Dashboard]

The graphs and tables in built-in dashboards support a number of metrics, including application metrics. The *Overview* tab provides overall measures. You can view more granular application metrics through the *Inbound*, *Outbound*, and *Failure* tabs.

Example use cases for monitoring are end-to-end tracing of API calls and dependency analyses to help you isolate the source of issues. For example, you can track response times at each endpoint (outbound or inbound).

.Example: Average Response Time Grouped by Endpoint Outbound
image::dashboard-outbound-response-table.png[Average Response Time Grouped By Endpoint Outbound]

* Infrastructure-level and JVM metrics
* Performance metrics that break down inbound and outbound response times into averages and percentiles

== View a Built-in Dashboard

Built-in and custom dashboards are available from Anypoint Monitoring. You can view application metrics for applications deployed to CloudHub and to hybrid targets in both built-in and custom dashboards.

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform and click *Monitoring*.
. Select the *Environment* and *Resource name* for the app or API to view the corresponding dashboard.
. Click *View*. +
The built-in dashboard for the application or API is displayed.
. To switch to a dashboard for a different resource, click the built-in dashboard selector at the top of the page.

[[endpoint-operation-metrics]]
== How Endpoint and Operation Use Metrics Are Gathered

Anypoint Monitoring collects top occurring endpoints or operations for each data collection interval. Endpoints or operations that are not top occurring are sorted into a group called *Other*.

In each data collection interval, top occurring endpoints or operations vary. An endpoint or operation that is top occurring in one interval may not be top occurring in the next.

In Anypoint Monitoring charts and tables, the data comes from multiple data collection intervals. As a result, aggregated data shown in the dashboard is an estimation since the intervals may not have the same top occurring endpoints or operations. The tables show approximate counts for the most commonly occurring endpoints or operations when the *Other* grouping appears.

For example, when an endpoint occurs more often than other endpoints in one interval but occurs less often in another interval (thus sorting it into the *Other* group for that interval), the resulting table displays lower than actual values for that endpoint, since the metrics that do not appear are grouped into the *Other* group.
