Built-in dashboards display deployment information about your application at the top of the screen and provide access to a number of different graphs, for example:

image::dashboard-built-in-info.png[Deployment Info on an App in a Built-In Dashboard]

The graphs and tables in built-in dashboards support a number of metrics, including application metrics. The *Overview* tab provides overall measures. You can view more granular application metrics through the *Inbound*, *Outbound*, and *Failure* tabs.

Example use cases for monitoring are end-to-end tracing of API calls and dependency analyses to help you isolate the source of issues. For example, you can track response times at each endpoint (outbound or inbound).

.Example: Average Response Time Grouped by Endpoint Outbound

* Infrastructure-level and JVM metrics
* Performance metrics that break down inbound and outbound response times into averages and percentiles

== View a Built-in Dashboard

Built-in and custom dashboards are available from Anypoint Monitoring. You can view application metrics for applications deployed to CloudHub and to hybrid targets in both built-in and custom dashboards.

. Sign into Anypoint Platform and click *Monitoring*.
. Select the *Environment* and *Resource name* for the app or API to view the corresponding dashboard.
. Click *View*. +
The built-in dashboard for the application or API is displayed.
. To switch to a dashboard for a different resource, click the built-in dashboard selector at the top of the page.

Your data is pre-populated and displayed in the built-in dashboards and logs, so no configuration is needed.

Built-in dashboards include various pages to view different types of charts.

The *Connectors* tab does not display for apps deployed to CloudHub. 

If you don't see the *Connectors* tab, verify that you have a Titanium subscription to Anypoint Platform and that the app you selected is a hybrid app deployed to a server, server group, or cluster. See xref:monitor-connectors.adoc[Monitor Connectors].

If you have a Titanium subscription and the selected application is hybrid, this graph changes to *System Memory*.
* System Memory: This graph displays only if you have a Titanium subscription and the selected application is hybrid. This graph displays the total free system memory per worker.
* Thread Count - Server: Number of simultaneous requests for a worker over time
