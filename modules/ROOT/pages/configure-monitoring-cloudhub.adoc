= Configure and Enable Anypoint Monitoring for Mule Apps (CloudHub)
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

To start monitoring Mule apps that are managed in CloudHub, you must deploy them to a supported version of Mule runtime engine and set the runtime version in your Mule app.

== Supported Versions of Mule Deployed to CloudHub

Anypoint Monitoring with Mule runtime engine images receive patch updates as soon as they are available. Because Anypoint Monitoring -AM images are no longer receiving patch updates, switch to a Mule runtime engine (non-AM) image if your production environment requires a Mule runtime engine patch.

Metrics and logs are supported in the following Mule versions:

* 4.x.x
* 3.9.x
* 3.8.7

Metrics are used by graphs and other charts within xref:dashboards.adoc[Dashboards].

Logs are available only if you have a Titanium subscription to Anypoint Platform.

== Set the Runtime Version

To set or change the runtime version for your Mule app:

* For new and existing Mule apps:
+
. Go to *Settings* in Runtime Manager for that app.
. Choose the new runtime from the *Runtime Version* selector.
+
If you do not see a supported runtime version in the drop-down menu, scroll down
to *Show Old Patch Releases*, click, and select a runtime for your app.
+
* For Anypoint CLI deployments:
+
If you are using the Anypoint CLI to deploy your Mule app (for example,
through a build pipeline), you need to include the `--runtime` parameter with
an appropriate value, for example:
+
[src,command,linenums]
----
anypoint-cli --username="..." --password="..."
 --organization="Mythical, Inc"
 --environment="Production" runtime-mgr cloudhub-application deploy
 --runtime="3.9.4" helloworld ~/demoproj2.zip
----
+
* For Maven deployments:
+
If you are using Maven for deployment, you must modify the `<muleVersion>`
tag in the `pom.xml` file. For example, changing `<muleVersion>3.9.3</muleVersion>` to `<muleVersion>3.9.4</muleVersion>`).

== Enable Monitoring for apps deployed to CloudHub

You can enable monitoring for Mule apps running on non-AM versions of Mule in the Anypoint Monitoring *Settings* page, the application's *Settings* page, or by using the Anypoint CLI for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

For supported versions of Mule, see xref:configure-monitoring-cloudhub.adoc[Configure Anypoint Monitoring for Mule Apps].

== Enable Monitoring Using the UI

You can use the *Settings* page in Anypoint Monitoring to enable or disable apps deployed to CloudHub and running on Mule.

. Sign into Anypoint Platform and navigate to *Anypoint Monitoring*.
. In the menu on the left, click *Settings*.
+
image::monitoring-settings-screen.png[]
+
. Select *CloudHub*.
. In the *Environment* drop-down list, select the environment where the application is running. +
A list of running applications is displayed for the selected environment. +
You can search for a specific application using the *List of resources* search box.
. Next to the application, click *Enable* to enable monitoring for the application, or *Disable* to disable monitoring for the application. +

== Enable Monitoring in CloudHub Settings

You can enable monitoring for Mule apps running on supported versions of Mule by adding a property to an application deployed to CloudHub.

. Sign into Anypoint Platform and navigate to *Runtime Manager*.
. In the list of applications, select the application for which to enable monitoring. +
The application must be deployed to CloudHub and running on a supported version of Mule.
. In the menu on the left, click *Settings*.
. Click *Properties*, and add the following property: +
`anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.enabled=true`
+
image::enable-monitoring-cloudhub.png[]
+
To disable monitoring, change the value to `false`.
. Click *Apply Changes*.

== Enable Monitoring for CI/CD Deployments

Use the Anypoint CLI and set the following property during your CI/CD deployment:
`anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.enabled=true`

== Performance Impact

Enabling Monitoring can impact CPU utilization and memory utilization, which varies depending upon specific application configuration. MuleSoft recommends that you test any performance impact in your pre-production environment prior to enabling monitoring in your production environment to ensure optimal performance and sizing.
