== About Reports
Reports allow you to view a list of all the CloudHub applications running in an environment. The reports display information about overall performance and behavior across all the applications in the environment. These reports can help you identify application performance and availability problems across the environment so you can better maintain the expected level of service for your applications.

From any of the *Reports* tabs, you can:

* Navigate to reports that display information about requests, performance, failures, and CPU and memory utilization.
* Switch environments
* Select a time range to view the reports for
* Click an application in the list to go to its built-in dashboard
* Click on column headings to sort the lists from highest to lowest, or from lowest to highest numbers
* Refresh the page
* Export a report as a CSV file.
