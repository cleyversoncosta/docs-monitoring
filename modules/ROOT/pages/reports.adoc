* Performance: View the request volume and average response time (how quickly the application serves each request).
* Failures: View the request volume and number of times requests to the application have failed.
* CPU Utilization: View the average percent of CPU each application in the environment uses.
* Memory Utilization: View statistics for average memory utilization, total memory, and memory pressure of each application running in the environment.

You can click on the application name to view the built-in dashboard for that application.
