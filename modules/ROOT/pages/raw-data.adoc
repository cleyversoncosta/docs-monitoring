You can use Anypoint Monitoring to download archived log data (raw data) collected on Mule apps that are running in CloudHub. Having access to this data can be helpful for security, compliance, or other purposes where you need to examine or collect your warehoused data. Note that log data is archived regularly, as shown in the example.
