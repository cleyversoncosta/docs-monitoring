When you set up alerts, you can enable or disable any of them, filter alerts based on the <<alert_status, alert status>>, and link to the graph in a custom dashboard that is associated with the alert.

The *Alerts* page shows basic alerts for servers and apps or advanced alerts (https://www.mulesoft.com/anypoint-pricing[Titanium subscription required]) for graphs in custom dashboards.

== Filtering Alerts by Alert Status

[[alert_status]]
You can use the following alert status filters:

All states::
Lists all alerts.

No data::
No data is available in the series to evaluate the alert threshold.

Disabled::
The alert is disabled.

Alerting::
The value of the metric passes the specified threshold.

OK::
The value of the metric has not passed the threshold.

Pending::
The alert is enabled and waiting for evaluation.

== Enabling and Disabling Alerts

You can activate or deactivate an alert by toggling the <<alerts, switch>> on the right.

* Enabling a disabled alert causes the alert to transition to `Pending` until it is time for evaluation. +
Depending on the value, the alert transitions to `OK` or `Alerting`.
* Disabling an alert causes the alert to transition to `Disabled`.
