Anypoint Monitoring custom dashboards provide a way for you to configure singlestat charts for a single measure (such as a response time or heap usage) of your Mule app environment over a given time range.

//GENERAL SETTINGS shared by singlestat and graph

// TIME RANGE SETTINGS shared by singlestat and table

== Options Tab

The *Options* tab includes settings for singlestat <<value_singlestat, values>>, <<font_singlestat, fonts>>, <<color_singlestat, coloring>>, <<spark_singlestat, spark lines>>, and <<gauge_singlestat, gauge icon>> settings.

[[value_singlestat]]
=== Value Settings for Singlestats

Configure values for your singlestat. Value settings include the type of value you want (such as an average), the unit of measure, and others.

2+| Values
| Stat a|

The value displayed by the singlestat. Available Settings:

* Min: Minimum of recorded values for the specified metric.
* Max: Maximum of recorded values for the specified metric.
* Average: Average of the recorded values for the specified metric.
* Current: The current value for the specified metric.
* Total: Sum of recorded values for the specified metric.
* Name: Name of the metric (for example, `worker-0`).
* First: The first recorded value for the specified metric.
* Delta: The total incremental increase in the series.
* Difference: The difference between the Current value (last value) and the First value.
* Range: The difference between Min and Max.
* Time of Last Point: Timestamp of the last reading.
| Prefix | Prepends text to the singlestat value.
| Postfix | Appends text to the singlestat value.
| Unit | Unit of measurement to display with the singlestat value (for example, `percent (0-100)`).
| Decimals | Overrides the automatic decimal precision for the legend and tooltips.
| Font size | Select the font size for the stat, prefix, and postfix.
|===

[[color_singlestat]]
=== Coloring and Thresholds

Add color-coded thresholds to a singlestat so that you can see whether it exceeds or stays within expected limits.

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| Coloring
| Background | Adds a background color determined by the *Thresholds* setting.
| Value | Applies a color for the current singlestat value that matches the color determined by the *Thresholds* setting.
| Thresholds | Sets a threshold using a numeric range such as `10,20` to distinguish values between the two numbers, below left-most number, and above the right-most number.
| Colors | Sets the colors for the values that are below, within, or above the *Thresholds* settings. You can invert the colors, as needed.
|===

[[spark_singlestat]]
=== Spark Lines

Provide spark line settings for a singlestat to provide visual representation of the data.

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| Spark Lines
| Show | Checkbox to show or hide the spark line.
| Full Height | For covering the full height of the singlestat.
| Line Color | For selecting the color of the spark line.
| Fill Color | For selecting the color of the area below the spark line.
|===

[[gauge_singlestat]]
=== Gauge

Display an arc-like gauge that represents the value of the singlestat.

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| Gauge
| Show | Checkbox for showing or hiding the gauge.
| Min | Sets a minimum value (such as `0` for a gauge that shows a percentage).
| Max | Sets a maximum value (such as `100` for a gauge that shows a percentage).
| Threshold Labels | Checkbox for showing or hiding your Threshold settings.

After you complete your configuration, you can click Save Changes. To exit the configuration and return to the dashboard, simply click *X*.

== Value Mappings

From the *Value Mappings* configuration tab, you can provide a human-readable label for a summary statistic.

2+| Range to Text Settings
| Value to Text | Maps a number to a textual description, for example: `0` -> `Error`, `1` -> `Success`
| Range to Text | Maps a numeric range to a textual description, for example: From `5` To `10` Text `Warning`
