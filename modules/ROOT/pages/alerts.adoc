Alerts indicate whether a resource (such as a Mule app) is behaving as expected or exceeding a defined threshold.

You can implement any of several types of alerts. From the *Alerts* page in Anypoint Monitoring, you can create xref:alerts-config.adoc#basic-alerts[basic alerts], or you can link to alerts for API Manager and Runtime Manager alerts.
If you have a Titanium subscription, you can also view, enable, and disable xref:alerts-config.adoc#advanced-alerts[advanced alerts] that are configured for graphs in custom dashboards.

// should the below information remain here? Or should we redo this when we address Trust?

When you configure an advanced alert for a graph, an alert status icon appears at the top-left corner of the graph. For example, the green dot in the bell indicates that the status is `OK`:

Note that hovering over the bell icon triggers a description popup. In this case, the description indicates `Status OK`. See xref:alerts-using.adoc#alert_status[Filtering Alerts by Alert Status] to understand each alert status.

//When the data exceed a configured threshold on your resources over a period of time, you can also receive notification to take action.


//TODO: VERIFY THAT ALL THESE FEATURES ARE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED
////
Alerting features in Anypoint Monitoring include:

* Threshold-based alerting: Notification when a specific metric that is related to a resource goes beyond the acceptable threshold for the period of time that you define.
* Batch Alert Assignments: Assignment of your alert definitions to multiple resources of the same type at once to help you save time of setting up each individually.
* Channel Integrations: Ability to specify a channel (such as PagerDuty, SMS, or Slack) to which notifications are sent.
* Alert Rollup: Ability to received a limited number of notifications on the same issue so that crucial notifications do not get overlooked because they are buried within a lot of redundant notifications.
* Alert History: An Alert History page shows status changes of a single alert. When you are troubleshooting an issue, you can have a view of historic data and see if the current issue has any precedent.
