= Configuring Alerts
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Depending on your subscription level, you can configure different types of alerts:

* Operational alerts for APIs through API Manager
* Operational alerts for the runtime through Runtime Manager
* Alerts for graphs in custom dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring.
+
Limit: Up to 20 alerts per organization.
+
Note that thresholds are checked every 5 minutes. The evaluated query is the average value of the metric in the last 5 minutes. The evaluated metric is the one referenced in the General tab for the graph. If the value is above the threshold, the alert is triggered. The alert is triggered only if the alert state changes (from OK state to Alerting state or vice versa).

== Setting Up API and Runtime Alerts

From Alerts in Anypoint Monitoring, you can link out to configuration pages for API and Runtime alerts.

Depending on your subscription level:

* If no alerts are set up, you might see links for API and Runtime alert setup, for example:

** API Operational Alerts: For guidance with alerts in API Manager, see xref:2.x@api-manager::using-api-alerts.adoc[About API Alerts]. Note that these alerts are not listed in the Alerts page for Anypoint Monitoring.
** Runtime Operational Alerts: For guidance with alerts in Runtime Manager, see xref:runtime-manager::alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[About Configuring Alerts using Runtime Manager]. Note that these alerts are not listed in the Alerts page for Anypoint Monitoring.
* *https://www.mulesoft.com/anypoint-pricing[Titanium Subscription Required]* - Instead of seeing links to API and Runtime alerts, you receive visual guidance showing how to open the configuration area for alerts in graphs for custom dashboards:

== Setting up Alerts for Graphs in Custom Dashboards

You can set up alerts to trigger email notifications when a data point you are measuring (`JVM - CPU % Utilization`) exceeds a specified threshold. These alerts are listed
in the Alerts page in Anypoint Monitoring.

== Adding Alerts

Once alerts are listed on your Alerts page, you can use Add Alerts to link out to API and Runtime Alert configuration pages. You can also get basic instructions for configuring alerts for a chart (widget) in a custom dashboard.

Note that you can also select to add or edit an alert from a chart in a custom dashboard, for example:
