= Configuring Alerts

Depending on your subscription level, you can configure different types of alerts:

* Basic alerts for servers and Mule apps
+
Limit per organization: Up to 50 basic alerts for users who do not have a Titanium subscription to Anypoint Platform. +
If you have a Titanium subscription, the limit is 100 basic alerts, and the limits increase as you purchase more vCores. For complete details about subscriptions, contact your customer support representative. See also https://www.mulesoft.com/anypoint-pricing[Anypoint Platform pricing].
* Advanced alerts for graphs in custom dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring
+
Limit per organization: Up to 20 advanced alerts.
+
Note that thresholds are checked every 5 minutes. The evaluated query is the average value of the metric in the last 5 minutes. The evaluated metric is the one referenced in the *General* tab for the graph. If the value passes the threshold, the advanced alert is triggered. The advanced alert is triggered only if the alert state changes (from `OK` state to `Alerting` state or vice versa).
* Operational alerts for APIs through API Manager
* Operational alerts for the runtime through Runtime Manager

== Set up Basic Alerts for Servers and Mule Apps

You can set up basic alerts to trigger email notifications when a metric you are measuring passes a specified threshold.

You can create basic alerts for the following metrics for servers or Mule apps:

* For on-premises servers and CloudHub apps:
** CPU utilization
** Memory utilization
** Thread count
* For on-premises, Runtime Fabric, and CloudHub apps:
** Message count
** Message error count
** Message response time

=== Create a Basic Alert

When you create a basic alert, you can select a source for the basic alert, configure the condition under which the basic alert is triggered, and specify which email addresses receive notifications for basic alert triggers.

To create a basic alert:

. Navigate to Anypoint Monitoring.
. Click the *Alerts* tab.
. Click the *+ New Alerts* button.
. Click *Basic alert*.
. In the *Add basic alert* window, enter the information required to create your basic alert. +
Note that requirements change depending on the source type you select.
. Click *Save*.

== Set up Advanced Alerts for Graphs in Custom Dashboards

*https://www.mulesoft.com/anypoint-pricing[Titanium Subscription Required]*

You can set up advanced alerts to trigger email notifications when a data point you are measuring (`JVM - CPU % Utilization`) passes a specified threshold. These advanced alerts are listed in the *Alerts* page in Anypoint Monitoring.

== Configure API Manager and Runtime Manager Alerts

From the *Alerts* page in Anypoint Monitoring, you can link to configuration pages for API Manager and Runtime Manager alerts.

Depending on your subscription level:

* If no alerts are set up, you might see links for API and Runtime alert setup, for example:
+

+
** API Operational Alerts: For guidance with alerts in API Manager, see xref:2.x@api-manager::using-api-alerts.adoc[About API Alerts]. Note that these alerts are not listed in the Alerts page for Anypoint Monitoring.
** Runtime Operational Alerts: For guidance with alerts in Runtime Manager, see xref:runtime-manager::alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[About Configuring Alerts using Runtime Manager]. Note that these alerts are not listed in the Alerts page for Anypoint Monitoring.
* *https://www.mulesoft.com/anypoint-pricing[Titanium Subscription Required]* - Instead of seeing links to API and Runtime alerts, you receive visual guidance showing how to open the configuration area for alerts in graphs for custom dashboards:
