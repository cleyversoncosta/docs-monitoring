The Anypoint Custom Metrics connector enables you to send operational and business metric values from a hybrid application to Anypoint Monitoring, where the metrics can be visualized in real time using a custom dashboard in advanced mode and the built-in *Custom metrics* dashboard. 

Once you define metrics in the Custom Metrics connector, you can select which metrics to display in the dashboard. You can filter and group the metrics along the included dimensions. You can include multiple custom and built-in metrics in a single dashboard visualization.

[NOTE] 
====
To see metrics that you configured in the Anypoint Custom Metrics connector in Anypoint Monitoring, you must have a Titanium subscription. +
This feature is currently supported only for hybrid applications.

== Prerequistes

* Mule runtime engine 4.1.x
* xref:am-installing.adoc[Install the Anypoint Monitoring Agent]

== Configure the Custom Metrics Values Using Design Center

. Search Anypoint Exchange for the Anypoint Custom Metrics connector. 

. Select the trigger for your flow.
. Select the *Anypoint Custom Metrics Connector* as the *Target* in your flow, and click *Done*. 
+

+
The connector has one operation called "Send custom metric." 
. On the design canvas, open the Anypoint Custom Metrics Connector card to add your metrics.
. In *Metric Name*, enter a meaningful value. 
. Next to *Enter Contextual Information*, click *Add* to enter the name and value for the metric's dimension.  
+
image::custom-metric-dc-add-dimension.png[]
.. In the *Add Item* dialog box, enter the *Name* and *Value* for the dimension.
.. Leave the *Collapsible* option with the default of *True*.
.. Click *OK*. 
+

+
You can repeat these steps to add multiple key values.
.  Next to *Enter Measurements*, click *Add* to add facts for the metric. Values for measurements are always numerical.
.. In the *Add Item* dialog box, enter a *Name* and numerical *Value* for the fact. +
[NOTE]
For facts, the value must always be numerical. This is not validated at design time, but it will cause a runtime exception once deployed.
.. Leave the *Collapsible* option with the default of *True*.
.. Click *Finish*. +
You can repeat these steps to add multiple key values.
. Select the *Throw Runtime Exception on Validation Failure* option if you want the flow to break if invalid values are entered for the metric. If this option is left unchecked, an error will be logged, but the flow won't break.


== Configure Custom Metrics Values Using Anypoint Studio

. Search Anypoint Exchange for the Anypoint Custom Metrics connector. +
. Drag the *Send Custom Metric* operation to the canvas. 
. Add the *Send Custom Metric* operation to your application flow. +
This image shows an example flow for custom metrics in Anypoint Studio. 
+
image::custom-metric-example-flow.png[]
. Click the *Send Custom Metric* operation to add values for the operation. 
. Add the dimension for the metric:
.. In *Metric name*, enter a meaningful value, for example "sales." 
.. In *Enter contextual information* select *Edit inline* to enter the name and value for the dimension. 
.. Click the green plus on the left to enter the values.
.. In the *Dimension* dialog box, enter the *Name* and *Value* for the dimension.
.. Leave the *Collapsible* option with the default of *True*.
.. Click *Finish*. +
You can repeat these steps to add multiple key values.
. Enter the facts for the metric. Values for measurements are numerical.
.. In *Enter measurements* select *Edit inline* to enter the name and value for the metric.
.. In the *Fact* dialog box, enter a *Name* and numerical *Value* for the fact. +
[NOTE]
For facts, the value must always be numerical. This is not validated at design time, but it will cause a runtime exception once deployed.
.. Leave the *Collapsible* option with the default of *True*.
.. Click *Finish*. +
You can repeat these steps to add multiple key values. +

+
Select the *Throw runtime exception on validation failure* option if you want the flow to break if invalid values are entered for the metric. If this option is left unchecked, an error will be logged, but the flow won't break.

== Deploy the Application

. Deploy the application to a standalone Mule runtime engine 4.1.x.
. In Anypoint Monitoring, xref:dashboard-custom-config.adoc[add a new custom dashboard] for the custom metric. +
This image shows an example of the configuration for a graph to display t-shirt sales.
+
image::custom-metric-custom-dashboard-config.png[]
+
[NOTE]
You only see the custom metrics in the pre-populated metric selection drop-down lists once you have logged something for the custom metric.
