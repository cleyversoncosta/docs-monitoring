The Anypoint Custom Metrics connector enables you to send operational and business metric values from a hybrid application to Anypoint Monitoring, where the metrics can be visualized in real time using Custom Dashboards. 

Once the metrics are in a Custom Dashboard, you can filter and group the metrics along the included dimensions. You can include multiple custom and built-in metrics in a single dashboard visualization.

[NOTE] 
====
To use the Anypoint Custom Metrics connector, you must have a Titanium subscription. +
