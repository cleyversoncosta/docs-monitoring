= Set Up Basic Alerts for Servers and Mule Apps

You can set up basic alerts to trigger email notifications when a metric you are measuring passes a specified threshold.

You can create basic alerts for the following metrics for servers or Mule apps:

* For on-premises servers and CloudHub apps:
** CPU utilization
** Memory utilization
** Thread count
* For on-premises, Anypoint Runtime Fabric, and CloudHub apps:
** Message count
** Message error count
** Message response time

== Create a Basic Alert

When you create a basic alert, you can select a source for the basic alert, configure the condition under which the basic alert is triggered, and specify which email addresses receive notifications for basic alert triggers.

To create a basic alert:

. Navigate to Anypoint Monitoring.
. Click the *Alerts* tab.
. Click the *+ New Alerts* button.
. Click *Basic alert*.
. In the *Add basic alert* window, enter the information required to create your basic alert. 
+
Note that requirements change depending on the source type you select.
. Click *Save*.
