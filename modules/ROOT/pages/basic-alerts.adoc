= Set Up Basic Alerts for Servers and Mule Apps

You can set up basic alerts to trigger email notifications when a metric you are measuring passes a specified threshold.

You can create basic alerts for the following metrics for servers or Mule apps:

* For on-premises servers, server groups, server clusters, and apps deployed to Anypoint Runtime Fabric or CloudHub:
** CPU utilization
** Memory utilization
** Thread count
* For hybrid, Anypoint Runtime Fabric, and CloudHub apps:
** Message count
** Message error count
** Message response time

A basic alert typically triggers an e-mail within 5 to 15 minutes of an incident. However, the basic alert's timestamp reflects the actual time of the incident.

== Create a Basic Alert

When you create a basic alert, you can select a source for the basic alert, configure the condition under which the basic alert is triggered, and specify which email addresses receive notifications for basic alert triggers.

To create a basic alert:

. Navigate to Anypoint Monitoring.
. Click the *Alerts* tab.
. Click the *+ New Alerts* button.
. Click *Basic alert*.
. In the *Add basic alert* window, enter the information required to create your basic alert:

* *Name*
+
Unique and meaningful name for the alert
+
*Name* is limited to 256 characters.
* *Severity level*
+
Severity of the alert: *Critical*, *Warning*, or *Info*
See <<alert-severity>>.
+
* *Source type*
+
Source of the alert: applications or servers
+
* *Environment name*
+
Name of the environment where the resource is deployed
+
* *Resource name* or *Server name*
+
Application or server to apply the alert to
* *Condition*
+
Condition that triggers the alert
+
See <<alert-conditions>>.
* *Subject*
+
Subject of the alert email to send when the alert is triggered
+
The subject can include variables.
See <<alert-variables>>.

* *Message*
+
Body text for the email to send when the alert is triggered
+
The message body can include variables.
See <<alert-variables>>.

* *Recipients*
+
Recipients of the alert email
+
You can select up to 20 platform user IDs and enter up to 20 email addresses.
. Click *Create*.

[[alert-severity]]
=== Alert Severity

The following levels of severity are available for basic alerts:

include::partial$include-alert-severity.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[[alert-conditions]]
=== Alert Conditions

For basic alerts, alert conditions consist of a metric, an operator, and a period of time that the condition is met.

==== Application Metrics

The following metrics are available if your alert is created for an application:

Message count::
Total number of Mule messages that are processed successfully

Message error count::
Number of Mule messages that return an exception in a flow

Message response time::
Response time (in milliseconds) of a message

CPU utilization::
Percent of CPU used
+
This metric is available only for apps deployed to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

Memory utilization::
Percent of memory used
+
This metric is available only for apps deployed to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

Thread count::
Total number of threads used
+
This metric is available only for apps deployed to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

==== Server Metrics

The following metrics are available if your alert is created for a server, server group, or server cluster:

CPU utilization::
Percent of CPU used

Memory utilization::
Percent of memory used

Thread count::
Total number of threads used

==== Operator

The _operator_ portion of the alert condition is the logic that is used against the metric you are measuring. The following operators are available:

* Above
* Above or equal
* Equal
* Below or equal
* Below

==== Time Period

The _time period_ defines how long the metric meets the criteria defined using the operator and chosen value. Note that a basic alert is triggered only if the condition is met for the selected time period continuously, not cumulatively. The following time periods are available:

* 5 minutes
* 10 minutes
* 15 minutes
* 20 minutes

== Basic Alert Email Template

You can use the following variables in a basic alert email *Subject* and *Message* fields.
For the description of each variable, see <<alert-variables>>.
