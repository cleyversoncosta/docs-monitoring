= Set Up Basic Alerts for Servers and Mule Apps

You can set up basic alerts to trigger email notifications when a metric you are measuring passes a specified threshold.

You can create basic alerts for the following metrics for servers or Mule apps:

* For on-premises servers and CloudHub apps:
** CPU utilization
** Memory utilization
** Thread count
* For on-premises, Anypoint Runtime Fabric, and CloudHub apps:
** Message count
** Message error count
** Message response time

A basic alert typically triggers an e-mail within 5 to 15 minutes of an incident. However, the basic alert's timestamp reflects the actual time of the incident.

== Create a Basic Alert

When you create a basic alert, you can select a source for the basic alert, configure the condition under which the basic alert is triggered, and specify which email addresses receive notifications for basic alert triggers.

To create a basic alert:

. Navigate to Anypoint Monitoring.
. Click the *Alerts* tab.
. Click the *+ New Alerts* button.
. Click *Basic alert*.
. In the *Add basic alert* window, enter the information required to create your basic alert:

* *Name*
+
Unique and meaningful name for the alert
+
The *Name* is limited to 256 characters.
* *Severity level*
+
Severity of the alert: *Critical*, *Warning*, or *Info*
See <<severity>>.
+
* *Source type*
+
The source of the alert: applications or servers
+
* *Environment name*
+
The name of the environment where the resource is deployed
+
* *Resource name* or *Server name*
+
The application or server to apply the alert to
* *Condition*
+
The condition that triggers the alert
+
See <<alert-conditions>>.
* *Subject*
+
The subject of the alert email to send when the alert is triggered
+
// The subject can include variables.
// See <<alert-variables>>.
* *Message*
+
The body text for the email to send when the alert is triggered
// The message body can include variables.

[[severity]]
=== Severity

The following levels of severity are available for basic alerts:

include::partial$include-alert-severity.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[[alert-conditions]]
=== Alert Conditions

For basic alerts, alert conditions consist of a metric, an operator, and a period of time that the condition is met.

==== Metrics

The following metrics are available if your alert is created for an application:

Message count::
The total number of Mule messages that are processed successfully

Message error count::
The number of Mule messages that return an exception in a flow.

Message response time::
The response time of a message in milliseconds

CPU utilization::
The percent of CPU used. This metric is available only for apps deployed to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

Memory utilization::
The percent of memory used. This metric is available only for apps deployed to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

Thread count::
The total number of threads used. This metric is available only for apps deployed to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

The following metrics are available if your alert is created for a server, server group, or server cluster:

CPU utilization::

Memory utilization::

Thread count::


==== Operator

The _operator_ portion of the alert condition is the logic that is used against the metric you are measuring. The following operators are available:

* Above
* Above or equal
* Equal
* Below or equal
* Below

==== Time Period

The _time period_ defines how long the metric meets the criteria defined using the operator and chosen value. The following time periods are available:

* 5 minutes
* 10 minutes
* 15 minutes
* 20 minutes
